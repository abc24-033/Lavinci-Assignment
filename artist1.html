    <h1><b>Jack Buddah</b></h1>
    <p>This artist works at the intersection of abstract expressionism and realism, creating pieces that are both emotionally evocative and visually grounded.
      Their work is distinguished by a masterful use of acrylic, gouache, and oil pastel, which allows for rich textural contrasts and vibrant layering.</p>

    <p>The use of mixed media enables the artist to play with both the fluidity and opacity of different materials, 
    resulting in dynamic compositions that feel both spontaneous and deliberate.</p>

    <p>Their art invites viewers into a space where logic and emotion coexist, encouraging personal reflection and emotional resonance.</p>

    <p>Whether through vibrant color fields, suggestive forms, or tactile brushwork, 
    the artist is continually exploring the boundary between what is seen and what is felt.</p>
