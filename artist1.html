<b>Ava Moreau</b> 
<p>is a neo-expressionist painter based in Paris, France.Neo-expressionism is an art movement that revives the intense emotion, bold color, and dramatic forms of earlier expressionism (like in the early 20th century), 
but often with more modern, raw, or abstract approaches.</p>
<p></p>Ava's work is described as having raw emotion and vivid textures, meaning she likely uses thick paint, gestural brushstrokes,
and emotional intensity to evoke strong feelings in viewers.
Her style may resemble artists like Jean-Michel Basquiat or Anselm Kiefer, but with her own Parisian and contemporary twist.</p>
