<b>Jack Buddah</b> 
<p>This artist works at the intersection of abstract expressionism and realism, creating pieces that are both emotionally evocative and visually grounded.
 Their work is distinguished by a masterful use of acrylic, gouache, and oil pastel, which allows for rich textural contrasts and vibrant layering.</p>
 <p>The use of mixed media enables the artist to play with both the fluidity and opacity of different materials, 
 resulting in dynamic compositions that feel both spontaneous and deliberate..</p>
 <p>Their art invites viewers into a space where logic and emotion coexist, encouraging personal reflection and emotional resonance.</p>
  <p>Whether through vibrant color fields, suggestive forms, or tactile brushwork, 
  the artist is continually exploring the boundary between what is seen and what is felt.</p>
